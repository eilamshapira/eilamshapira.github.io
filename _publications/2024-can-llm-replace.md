Economic choice prediction is an essential challenging task, often constrained by the difficulties
in acquiring human choice data. Indeed, experimental economics studies had focused mostly on
simple choice settings. The AI community has
recently contributed to that effort in two ways:
considering whether LLMs can substitute for humans in the above-mentioned simple choice prediction settings, and the study through ML lens
of more elaborated but still rigorous experimental
economics settings, employing incomplete information, repetitive play, and natural language communication, notably language-based persuasion
games. This leaves us with a major inspiration:
can LLMs be used to fully simulate the economic
environment and generate data for efficient human choice prediction, substituting for the elaborated economic lab studies? We pioneer the study
of this subject, demonstrating its feasibility. In
particular, we show that a model trained solely
on LLM-generated data can effectively predict
human behavior in a language-based persuasion
game, and can even outperform models trained on
actual human data.
