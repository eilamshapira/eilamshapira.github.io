     "Economic choice prediction is an essential challenging task, often constrained by the difficulties\n",
     "in acquiring human choice data. Indeed, experimental economics studies had focused mostly on\n",
     "simple choice settings. The AI community has\n",
     "recently contributed to that effort in two ways:\n",
     "considering whether LLMs can substitute for humans in the above-mentioned simple choice prediction settings, and the study through ML lens\n",
     "of more elaborated but still rigorous experimental\n",
     "economics settings, employing incomplete information, repetitive play, and natural language communication, notably language-based persuasion\n",
     "games. This leaves us with a major inspiration:\n",
     "can LLMs be used to fully simulate the economic\n",
     "environment and generate data for efficient human choice prediction, substituting for the elaborated economic lab studies? We pioneer the study\n",
     "of this subject, demonstrating its feasibility. In\n",
     "particular, we show that a model trained solely\n",
     "on LLM-generated data can effectively predict\n",
     "human behavior in a language-based persuasion\n",
     "game, and can even outperform models trained on\n",
     "actual human data.\n",
