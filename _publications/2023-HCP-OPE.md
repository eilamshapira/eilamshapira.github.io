Persuasion games have been fundamental in economics and AI research, and
have significant practical applications. Recent works in this area have started
to incorporate natural language, moving beyond the traditional stylized message
setting. However, previous research has focused on on-policy prediction, where the
train and test data have the same distribution, which is not representative of real-life
scenarios. In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of off-policy evaluation
(OPE) in language-based persuasion games. To address the inherent difficulty of
human data collection in this setup, we propose a novel approach which combines
real and simulated human-bot interaction data. Our simulated data is created by an
exogenous model assuming decision makers (DMs) start with a mixture of random
and decision-theoretic based behaviors and improve over time. We present a deep
learning training algorithm that effectively integrates real interaction and simulated
data, substantially improving over models that train only with interaction data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of real interaction and simulation mixtures as a
cost-effective and scalable solution for OPE in language-based persuasion games.
