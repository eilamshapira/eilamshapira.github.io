I'm Eilam, currently a PhD Candidate at the [Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/).
My main field of research is Language-based games: Natural Language Processing (NLP) in strategic environment.  

My advisors are Prof. [Roi Reichart](https://roireichart.com/) and Prof.
[Moshe Tennenholtz](https://dds.technion.ac.il/he/academicstaff/moshe-tennenholtz/).

I am passionate about combining strategic thinking in every field of my life. It mainly comes into planning the best trips and winning board games - my wife can vouch for both.
Iâ€™m also fond of hiking, cooking, and supporting my favorite basketball team, Hapoel Jerusalem.

Whether you need assistance in NLP,  hiking tips, or just for a conversation, feel free to reach out!
