Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I'm Eilam, currently a PhD Candidate at the [Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/).
My main field of research is Language-based games: Natural Language Processing (NLP) in strategic environments.  

My advisors are Prof. [Roi Reichart](https://roireichart.com/) and Prof.
[Moshe Tennenholtz](https://dds.technion.ac.il/he/academicstaff/moshe-tennenholtz/).

I'm deeply passionate about infusing strategic thinking into all aspects of my life, from planning memorable trips to winning board games - my wife can vouch for both.
I'm also fond of hiking, cooking, and supporting my favorite basketball team, Hapoel Jerusalem.
